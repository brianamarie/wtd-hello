title: Things to do in Portland
---

This is a book created by the amazingly talented attendees of the How to Git workshop at Write the Docs - Portland 2017. During this workshop, we will be using the [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) to create individual pages identifying who we are!

As part of this lesson, we will be doing the following:

- Communicate our desire to make changes to the project using Issues.
- Creating a feature branch to add our content to.
- Making changes to the project files and identifying those changes with commits and well crafted commit messages.
- Pushing those changes to the classroom repository.
- Create a Pull Request identifying the changes we want to introduce to the project.
- Collaborating on the changes we are introducing with other workshop attendees.
- Merging our content and seeing it published on our website.
